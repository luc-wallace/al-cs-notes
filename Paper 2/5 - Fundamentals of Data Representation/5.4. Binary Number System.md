## Binary Number System

A binary number consists of a string of 1s and 0s. It can either be *signed* or *unsigned*.

Unsigned binary values can only represent positive numbers. Negative numbers can only be represented using signed binary.

## Numbers with a fractional part

Binary can be used to represent numbers that have a fractional part. There are two ways of doing this: *fixed point* and *floating point*.

### Fixed point

When using fixed point with a given number of bits, a specified number of bits are placed before a binary point and the remaining ones fall behind.

A column $n$ to the left of the binary point has a value of $2^n$:
$$... \enspace 16 \enspace 8 \enspace 4 \enspace 2 \enspace1$$
A column $n$ to the right of the binary point has a place value of $1 \div 2^n$:
$$ \frac{1}{2} \enspace \frac{1}{4} \enspace \frac{1}{8} \enspace \frac{1}{16} \enspace ...$$

For example, the 8-bit fixed point binary number $1011.0101$ can be converted to denary as so:
$$8 + 2 + 1 + \frac{1}{4} = 11.3125$$
### Floating point

Floating point binary is comparable to scientific notation as it consists of a *mantissa* and an *exponent*.

In exam questions, these are both represented in two's complement signed binary.

In floating point binary, a number of bits are assigned to the mantissa, with the remaining bits being assigned to the exponent.

#### Converting floating point to decimal

1. Convert the exponent to decimal
2. Treat the mantissa as if there is a binary point between the second and first digits, then move the binary point the number of positions specified by the mantissa
3. Treat the mantissa as a fixed point binary number

#### Converting decimal to floating point

1. Convert the number into a fixed point representation
2. Normalise the number:
	- The number must start with 01 if a positive number, or 10 if a negative number
	- The exponent is the number of positions the binary point has to be moved to achieve this
3. Write mantissa and exponent together

### Rounding errors

Some decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly in binary, as binary represents all numbers as a power of 2.
