## Binary Number System

A binary number consists of a string of 1s and 0s. It can either be *signed* or *unsigned*.

Unsigned binary values can only represent positive numbers. Negative numbers can only be represented using signed binary.

## Numbers with a fractional part

Binary can be used to represent numbers that have a fractional part. There are two ways of doing this: *fixed point* and *floating point*.

### Fixed point

When using fixed point with a given number of bits, a specified number of bits are placed before a binary point and the remaining ones fall behind.

A column $n$ to the left of the binary point has a value of $2^n$:
$$... \enspace 16 \enspace 8 \enspace 4 \enspace 2 \enspace1$$
A column $n$ to the right of the binary point has a place value of $1 \div 2^n$:
$$ \frac{1}{2} \enspace \frac{1}{4} \enspace \frac{1}{8} \enspace \frac{1}{16} \enspace ...$$

For example, the 8-bit fixed point binary number:
$$1011.0101$$
Has a value of:
$$8 + 2 + 1 + \frac{1}{4} = 11.3125$$
### Floating point

Floating point binary is comparable to scientific notation as it consists of a *mantissa* and an *exponent*.
