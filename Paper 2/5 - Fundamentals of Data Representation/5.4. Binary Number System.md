## Binary Number System

A binary number consists of a string of 1s and 0s. It can either be *signed* or *unsigned*.

Unsigned binary values can only represent positive numbers. Negative numbers can only be represented using signed binary.

## Numbers with a fractional part

Binary can be used to represent numbers that have a fractional part. There are two ways of doing this: *fixed point* and *floating point*.

### Fixed point

When using fixed point with a given number of bits, a specified number of bits are placed before a binary point and the remaining ones fall behind.

A column $n$ to the left of the binary point has a value of $2^n$.
$$... 128 _ 64$$

A column $n$ to the right of the binary point has a place value of $1 \div 2^n$
