# External Hardware Devices


## Input and output devices

In order to make use of data, computers must be able to use various devices which allow the computer to have data input and output.

### Barcodes and barcode readers

Barcodes are printed diagrams that consist of light and dark portions. They contain information which can be read by a computer using a barcode reader.

There are two main types of barcode:
- 1D
- 2D (QR codes)

2D barcodes can contain more information in the same amount of space as a 1D barcode but require more processing in order to extract the data.

Barcode readers consist of:
- A laser light source
- A lens
- Photodiodes
- A mirror

The stages of barcode reading are:
1. The mirror directs light from the laser onto the barcode
2. The light reflects light off the barcode into the photodiodes
	- Lighter portions of the barcode will reflect more light
	- Darker portions of the barcode will absorb more light
3. The photodiodes turn light into electrical charge
4. The charge is measured to create a digital signal corresponding to the content of the barcode

Barcodes can have error detection and prevention methods such as parity bits and check digits built-in, allowing computers to tell if a barcode has been read incorrectly.

If a barcode fails to scan correctly, it can be rescanned until it is. Modern barcode readers can scan hundreds of times a second making this nearly unnoticeable to the human eye.

### Digital cameras

Digital cameras consist of:
- A lens
- A sensor
- A shutter

There are two commonly used types of sensor in a camera:
- CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor)
- CCD (charge coupled device)

Both of them convert incident light into electromagnetic charges. Charge builds up in cells, each representing a single pixel in the output image. Once the photo is taken, the charge in each cell is measured and converted into a digital value which is processed by the camera and stored as a digital image.

In colour cameras, there are multiple cells per pixel, each with a filter that lets in certain wavelengths of light. This lets the camera build up an image of the intensity of each colour in the photograph, enabling it to combine them to form a full colour image.

A *Bayer filter* is a special type of colour filter which has the same number of green pixels as red and blue pixels. This produces a photograph colour which is a closer approximation to what the human eye sees, which is most sensitive to green light.

### Laser Printer

A laser printer is an output device that produces images on paper from digital signals.

Laser printers, which print whole pages at a time, consist of:
- A laser light source
- A mirror
- A drum
- A toner roller
- Fusers

![A laser printer](laser-printer.png)

When a document is printed:
1. The drum is initially negatively charged
2. The laser is directed as its surface by the mirror
3. Areas on the drum incident to the laser are discharged, leaving an imprint of the image in charge on the drum
4. The drum is coated with negatively charged toner from the toner roller, which is attracted to the positively charged portions of the drum. The toner is then applied to the paper by the drum
5. The paper is heated by the users, fixing the toner to the paper

Colour printers apply the same process but with four different colours of toner, in order to achieve full colour print:
- Cyan
- Yellow
- Magenta
- Black

## RFID

RFID, which stands for radio frequency identification, is a method of transferring information wirelessly between a tag and a reader. RFID is used in contactless credit cards as well as in some hotel room cards.

Inside an RFID tag is:
- A chip that contains a small amount of memory
- A coil of wire that acts as an antenna

Most RFID tags are *passive*, meaning that they induce enough power wirelessly from the reader to operate the chip. However, *active tags* have a dedicated power supply enabling the chip to be read from a greater distance.

When an RFID tag is read:
1. The reader emits radio waves which are picked up by the tag's antenna
2. The power induced in the tag's antenna from these waves is enough to power up the chip which emits its own radio waves
3. The waves are picked up by the reader which decodes the information into a digital signal

## Secondary storage devices

A computer's primary storage is RAM or ROM. Secondary storage, which is used to store files and applications, includes:
- Hard disk drives (HDDs)
- Solid-state drives (SSDs)
- Optical disks

### Hard disk drives

A hard disk drives consists of:
- A number of circular platters which made from a magnetic material
- An actuating arm for each platter
- A read/write head for each actuating arm

The read/write head changes the magnetic polarity of parts of the platter. The actuating arm enables the read/write head to access all portions of the platter.

![Hard drive data](hard-drive-data.png)

Data in a hard drive is stored in concentric tracks, each further divided into sectors. The platter rotates thousands of times per minute enabling fast read/write speeds.

Hard drives typically come in capacities of 500GB to 5TB. Adding more platters and decreasing the width of the tracks are two ways of increasing the capacity of the disk without increasing size.

Hard drives contain a number of moving parts, which makes them susceptible to physical damage and damage from movement. This makes them unsuitable for portable devices like smartphones and tablets. They are also too large.

### Solid-state drives

Solid-state drives (SSDs) consist of:
- NAND flash memory cells
- A controller

The controller manages the structure of data on the drive.

NAND flash memory is non-volatile, meaning that an SSD's data is retained even when no power is being supplied. The memory cells are formed of floating gate transistors which store information by trapping electrical charge.

Data is stored on SSDs in *pages*, which are combined to form blocks.
