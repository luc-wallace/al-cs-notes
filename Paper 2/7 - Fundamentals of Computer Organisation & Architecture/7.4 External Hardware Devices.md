# External Hardware Devices



## Input and output devices

In order to make use of data, computers must be able to use various devices which allow the computer to have data input and output.

### Barcodes and barcode readers

Barcodes are printed diagrams that consist of light and dark portions. They contain information which can be read by a computer using a barcode reader.

There are two main types of barcode:
- 1D
- 2D (QR codes)

2D barcodes can contain more information in the same amount of space as a 1D barcode but require more processing in order to extract the data.

Barcode readers consist of:
- A laser light source
- A lens
- Photodiodes
- A mirror
