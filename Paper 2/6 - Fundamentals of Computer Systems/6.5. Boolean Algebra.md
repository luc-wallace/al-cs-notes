# Boolean Algebra

Like algebra in Mathematics, Boolean algebra concerns representing values with letters and simplifying expressions. Boolean algebra uses the values TRUE and FALSE which can be represented as $1$ and $0$ respectively.

## Notation

| $\overline{A}$ | NOT A   |
| -------------- | ------- |
| $A \cdot B$    | A AND B |
| $AB$           | A AND B |
| $A + B$        | A OR B  |

The order of precedence is as follows: NOT, AND, OR.

## Boolean identities

$\Large A \cdot 0 = 0 \;\;\;$  Anything AND 0 is always 0.
$\Large A \cdot 1 = A \;\;\;$ Anything AND 1 is always the original value.
$\Large A \cdot A = A \;\;\;$Anything AND itself is always the original value.

$\Large A + 0 = A \;\;\;$Anything OR 0 is the original value.
$\Large A + 1 = 1 \;\;\;$ Anything OR 1 is 1.
$\Large A + A = A \;\;\;$Anything OR itself is the original value.
