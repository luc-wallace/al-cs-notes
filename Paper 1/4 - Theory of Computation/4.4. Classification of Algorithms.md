# Classification of Algorithms


### Limits of computation

There exist two types of problem: *tractable* and *intractable*.

A *tractable* problem can be solved within a useful period of time. Tractable problems have polynomial or less time solution.

An *intractable* problem is theoretically solvable, but in a time complexity greater than polynomial time, e.g. exponential time. Due to the limits of computation, it may take millions of years to solve. 

For these type
