A tree traversal is the process of vising/updating/outputting each node in a tree. Unlike a graph traversal, a tree traversal is unique to trees and must start at the root node.

### Types of tree-traversal

There are three types of depth-first tree-traversal:
- Pre-order
- Post-order
- In-order

Pre-order and post-order can be performed on any type of tree, but an in-order traversal is only defined for binary trees.

#### Pre-order

Pre-order traversals are used for copying a tree. It can be performed on any tree.

A pre-order traversal always returns to a parent node when all of its descendant nodes have been considered, and it considers the nodes in the order they are traversed.

#### Post-order

Post-order traversals are used for converting an infix expression into Reverse Polish notation (RPN) and emptying a tree.

In a post-order traversal, a node is only considered when all of its descendant nodes have been considered, not when it is traversed for the first time.
