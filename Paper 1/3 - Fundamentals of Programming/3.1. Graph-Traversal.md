## Graph-Traversal

Graph-traversal is the process of visiting each vertex in a graph.

There are two algorithms in the spec for this: *depth-first search* and *breadth-first search*.
#### Depth-first search

Depth-first traversal uses a *stack*. It can be performed on any connected graph.

An example of an application of depth-first search is navigating a maze.
