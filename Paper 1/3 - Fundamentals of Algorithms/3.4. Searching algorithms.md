## Searching Algorithms

A searching algorithm's task is to find the location of an item in a list or verify if an item is in a list. The three studied searching algorithms are a *linear search*, a*binary search* and a *binary tree search*.

### Linear Search

A linear search is the most basic type of search, simply comparing each item in the list sequentially to the target. It can be performed on an unordered list and is rarely used in the real world.

Its time complexity is $O(n)$.

### Binary Search

A binary search can be used on any ordered list. It is an example of a *divide and conquer* algorithm which repeatedly compares the target against the current midpoint of the array, deleting the half of the list that the target cannot be located in.

Its time complexity is $O(\log$N)$.
