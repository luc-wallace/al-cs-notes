## Sorting algorithms

A sorting algorithm places items in a specific order. A sorted array is sometimes more useful than an unsorted one, e.g. for binary search.

The two studied sorting algorithms are *bubble sort* and *merge sort* (although people who take D1 FM know that *quick sort* is the best).

### Bubble sort

The bubble sort algorithm swaps the position of adjacent items to order them, performing multiple passes until no swaps are made.

It has a time complexity of $O(n^2)$.

### Merge sort

The merge sort algorithm orders the list by splitting it into smaller arrays and then reforming them. It is an example of a *divide and conquer* algorithm.

It has a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$.
