## Infix notation

In Maths, we use the infix order of notation, meaning the operator/opcode goes in-between the operands:

$1 + 1$

However, some operators take precedence over others, following the laws of BIDMAS. This can create confusion over the order of execution, such as in the following expression:

$1 + 1 \times 5$

Clearly, the multiplication expression should be evaluated first, but it is tricky for a computer to evaluate an infix expression directly.

## Reverse Polish Notation

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) is a postfix way of writing expressions. This eliminates the need for brackets and removes confusion about operator precedence.

Instead of the operator going between the operands, it goes after:

$1 \enspace 1 \enspace +$

All expressions can be easily evaluated using a stack.

## Converting from Infix to Postfix

Infix expressions can be converted to postfix by the postorder traversal of an expression tree. Simpler ones can be done by observation.

Infix:
$3 + (5 + 9) * 2$

Postfix:
$3 \enspace 5 \enspace 9 \: + \: 2 \: * \: +$
