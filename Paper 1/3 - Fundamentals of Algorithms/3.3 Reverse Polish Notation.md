## Infix notation

In Maths, we use the infix order of notation, meaning the operator goes in-between the operands:
$$
1 + 1
$$
However, some operators take precedence over others, following the laws of BIDMAS. This can create confusion over the order of execution, such as in the following expression:
$$
1 + 1 \times 5
$$
Clearly, the multiplication expression should be evaluated first, but it is tricky to
