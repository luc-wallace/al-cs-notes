## Graph-Traversal

Graph-traversal is the process of visiting each vertex in a graph. It can be performed on any connected graph.

There are two algorithms in the spec for this: *depth-first search* and *breadth-first search*.

In a traversal, a node is *completely explored* if all of its adjacent nodes have been considered.

### Depth-first search (DFS)

DFS uses a *stack*.

An example of an application of depth-first search is navigating a maze.

### Breadth-first search (BFS)

BFS uses a *queue*.

An example of an application of BFS is finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
